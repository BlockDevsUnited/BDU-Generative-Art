# What is a way to see this challenge?
You can consider that this challenge has two parts:
- Layers vision (Images)
- Developer vision (Art Engine)

So you can start with any of them: Art Engine or Images.

# Steps to run 

## Art Engine

Create generative art by using the canvas api and node js. Before you use the generation engine, make sure you have node.js and yarn installed.

## Installation

```sh
git clone 

yarn add all
```

## Usage

Create your different layers as folders in the 'layers' directory, and add all the layer assets in these directories. 

Once you have all your layers, go into `src/config.js` and update the `layersOrder` array to be your layer folders name in order of the back layer to the front layer.

*Example:* If you were creating a portrait design, you might have a background, then a head, a mouth, eyes, eyewear, and then headwear, so your `layersOrder` would look something like this:

```js
const layersOrder = [
    { name: 'Background'},
    { name: 'Ball'},
    { name: 'Eye color' },
    { name: 'Iris' },
    { name: 'Shine' },
    { name: 'Bottom lid' },
    { name: 'Top lid' },
];
```

The `name` of each layer object represents the name of the folder (in `/layers/`) that the images reside in. 

Then optionally, update your `format` size, ie the outputted image size, and the `editionSize`, which is the amount of variation outputted.

Make sure you have installed Canvas. You can install this node module by running the following command:

```sh
yarn add canvas@next
```
If for some reason the installation stays in a loop. Try stopping it and execute the command above again.

When you are all ready, run the following command and your outputted art will be in the `build` directory:

```sh
npm run build
```
## Images

In order to have your own generative arts you need to have some layers to use on your Art Engine.

### How can I create some layers?

You can use a free online editor and save your work locally by using: https://www.piskelapp.com/

- Click on Create Sprite and start creating some layers

So now you are able to start creating some layers. Right?

#### Creating layers step by step

If everything went well you will see PiskelApp ready to start creating:

![](images/piskelapp-ready.png)

In this case we are going to create two layers:
- Head Layer
- Skin Layer

##### Create your first layer

- Creating Head Layer

![](images/piskelapp-first-layer.png)

- Saving Head Layer

Click on Export button

![](images/piskelapp-export-first-layer.png)

- Personalize the Scale -> 10x is something that works
- Click on Download

![](images/piskelapp-download-first-layer.png)

The result

##### Create your second layer

Skin Layer

By clicking on Create a layer

![](images/piskelapp-create-layer-button.png)

- Creating Skin Layer

![](images/piskelapp-creating-second-layer.png)

- Deleting Head Layer

![](images/piskelapp-deleting-first-layer.png)

- Save your Skin Layer

The result

![](images/piskelapp-result-second-layer.png)

Now you probably have two things: the Art Engine ready to use and your layers. Time to try!

## LAST STEP: Collaborating Folder

There is a public folder where you can:

- Get some "skeleton" to use in your creations (Base folder)
- Save your layers so that they will be considered for the collection (Ready Creations folder). Consider give name to your layers that represents your original inspiration :)

Collaborating Folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1oH579VB0AQ5omF8-xYTeGbimGR23-qVp
